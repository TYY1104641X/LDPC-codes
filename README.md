# LDPC-codes
Understood LDPC codes and decoding codewords

Reference: https://www.itsoc.org/conferences/schools/past-schools/na-school-2009/lecture-files/Costello-3.pdf


The LDPC decoder is achieved by transmitting likelihood message over the tanner graph and simulated by MATLAB. 

I will continue updating the algorithm that transmit the log-likelihood message.


Please test the example by running main.m over MATLAB
