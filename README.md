The LDPC decoder is achieved by transmitting likelihood message over the tanner graph and simulated by MATLAB. 


I have achieved the decoding algorithms by transmitting both the likelihood probability and the log-ratio of probability. 


Please test the example by running main.m and main_log_LDPC over MATLAB
   
         a) main--test LDPC decoding by passing likelihood probability
   
         b) main_log_LDPC--test LDPC decoding by passing the log-ratio probability
